# Reviewing While loops:
# print a while loop that prints 1-12

i = 0

while i < 13:
	print(i)
	i+=1

# Write code to print multiples of 5 from 45 to 90

while i < 19:
	print(5*i)
	i += 1

# With your partner: discuss: What is a set? What is it good for?
# Write your response as a comment here:
# A set is an unordered that stores data and is good for storing data

# Create a variable called "myset" and put whatever you want in it:

myset = ['miss', 'cocoa', 'hot', 'mind', 'vibin', 'dime','sweater']


# Create a 2D numpy array of size 3x5 with numbers 1-15:

# Challenge: use while loop to print the following pattern:
